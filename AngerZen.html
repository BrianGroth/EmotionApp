    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This range spans from intense anger, rage, and frustration, passing through irritation and neutrality, progressing toward acceptance, tranquility, and ultimately achieving a state of inner peace and clarity (Satori or Zen).
    </p>
    <h2>Understanding</h2>
    <p>
      Feelings of resentment, agitation, or hostility place you towards the Anger end of this emotional range, signaling unmet needs or personal boundaries. Understanding these emotions helps you identify their triggers and work through them constructively. When your emotional state becomes reflective, accepting, and serene, you are approaching Satori, demonstrating emotional maturity and a balanced inner state.
